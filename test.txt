Let me tell you a story about a young boy who always dreamed of becoming the best violinist since childhood. Unfortunately, he was poor and his classmates and teachers used to make fun of him for having such a crazy dream

But guess what? Life took a turn and now the boy is performing his favorite song cover on stage in front of millions of people ðŸ¤© Isn't that amazing? He proved his doubters wrong and followed his passion âœ¨

As you probably guessed, this was heavily inspired by the story and plot of "The Greatest Showman."
